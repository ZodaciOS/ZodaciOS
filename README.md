iOS Tweak Developer & Security Researcher. Currently, I have several upcoming projects for tweaks, such as [Acrypt](https://github.com/ZodaciOS/Acrypt), a 
tweak that will allow users to encrypt apps using a passcode/touch/face ID & many more. 

Feel free to contact me for any questions, tweak issues, or suggestions.
